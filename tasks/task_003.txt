# Task ID: 3
# Title: Backend: Data Aggregation & Tiered API Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the data services and tiered architecture
# Details:
Create robust data services with proper caching, error handling, and tiered delivery.

# Test Strategy:
Test each service individually and verify integrated functionality with proper error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 3.1. Core Services Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core data services
### Details:
Create services for stablecoin metadata, peg stability analysis, transparency, oracle analysis, liquidity analysis, and audit discovery.

## 3.2. Tiered Data Fetch Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify data service to support progressive data delivery
### Details:
Implement getTier1Data, getTier2Data, and getTier3Data methods with appropriate performance targets.

## 3.3. Response Schema Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define progressive response object structure
### Details:
Create a consistent data structure across all tiers with proper backward compatibility.

## 3.4. Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize API calls and implement early return patterns
### Details:
Parallelize API calls within tiers and implement performance monitoring.

## 3.5. Streaming API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create streaming API route for tiered responses
### Details:
Implement progressive data transmission with proper headers and disconnection handling.

## 3.6. Tier-specific Caching Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement different cache durations per tier
### Details:
Set up T1: 24h, T2: 12h, T3: 6h caching with partial invalidation support.

## 3.7. Enhanced Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement partial success responses and granular error reporting
### Details:
Add per-tier error reporting and fallback data patterns for tier failures.

## 3.8. Backend Testing Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive testing for the tiered backend architecture
### Details:
Create functional tests for each tier, performance tests for response times, and API integration tests for data flow.

## 3.9. Backend Success Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and monitor performance and reliability metrics
### Details:
Establish metrics for response times (T1: <500ms, T2: <2s, T3: <5s, End-to-end: <7s) and reliability (99.9% availability, <1% error rate, >80% cache hits, 100% partial data on failures).
